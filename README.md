# Todo App 📋

**A simple web application for managing tasks, which works entirely in the browser.**  
A straightforward and convenient way to track your tasks with the ability to save progress in **localStorage**. All data remains in your browser, and no server-side is required.

## 🔧 Technologies

This project was built using the following technologies:
- **React** (for building the UI)
- **TypeScript** (for type safety)
- **Material UI** (for stylish and convenient components)
- **localStorage** (for storing data in the browser)

## 🎨 Interface Description

- A field to add a new task.
- A task list with the option to filter tasks: all tasks, incomplete tasks, completed tasks.
- A button to remove completed tasks.

**Important feature**: All data is stored in the browser using **localStorage**, meaning it never leaves your computer and is not sent to any server.

The app supports **light** and **dark** themes, which automatically switch based on your operating system's settings.
